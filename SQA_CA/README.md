### Task Estimation  
Task Estimation is used within a SCRUM framework to accurately plan each task in the sprint backlog.
Story points are the most popular method of task estimation within the SCRUM framework as they allow 
teams to measure tasks by the most relevant unit to their process as possible. A story point is a 
high-level estimation of the complexity of the user story. A story point can be any value that a 
SCRUM Team agrees on e.g. hours, days, weeks etc. In this project I have chosen the value of the 
story points to be in hours, therefore 1 hour = 1 point.  
  
To chose the estimates for the tasks in this project, I read through the entire project specifications
in order to determine the requirements needed to fulfil each task. Considering my technical skills and
knowledge on each task, I was able to estimate how long it would take me to code/ document the work 
completed on each task. I do not have much experience in creating a unit testing class so I estimated
this would be longer to create than creating the rubric and student grade classes as these are object
classes which I have created many of before.

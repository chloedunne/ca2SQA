### Task Estimation  
Task Estimation is used within a SCRUM framework to accurately plan each task in the sprint backlog.
Story points are the most popular method of task estimation within the SCRUM framework as they allow 
teams to measure tasks by the most relevant unit to their process as possible. A story point is a 
high-level estimation of the complexity of the user story. A story point can be any value that a 
SCRUM Team agrees on e.g. hours, days, weeks etc. In this project I have chosen the value of the 
story points to be in hours, therefore 1 hour = 1 point.  
  
To chose the estimates for the tasks in this project, I read through the entire project specifications
in order to determine the requirements needed to fulfil each task. Considering my technical skills and
knowledge on each task, I was able to estimate how long it would take me to code/ document the work 
completed on each task. I do not have much experience in creating a unit testing class so I estimated
this would be longer to create than creating the rubric and student grade classes as these are object
classes which I have created many of before. 

### Velocity Metric  
Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a Team can tackle during a single Sprint and is the key 
metric in Scrum. It is measured in either story points or hours, and is very useful for forecasting as 
it allows the team to estimate how much work they can do in future sprints. Velocity is calculated at the 
end of the Sprint by totalling the Points for all fully completed User Stories.

_Velocity Calculation Example_:   

Sprint 1:  
The team committed to completing 5 user stories and each user story had 4 story points.
This totals to 20 story points. The team fully completed 4/5 user stories.

Sprint 2:  
The team committed to completing 4 user stories and each user story had 4 story points.
This totals to 16 story points. The team fully completed 2/4 user stories.

Sprint 1: 4 user stories x 4 story points = 16  
Sprint 2: 2 user stories x 4 story points = 8  
Total = 24  

Average sprint velocity is equal to 24 รท 2 = 12.
